# Recommender_System_Python_
This project is based on making a recommender system on Python. To do so, we had to develop the entiere system. we started with basic datas (userID,itemID and rating) and we had to evaluate 3 different recommender systems through MAE,RMSE,RME and recommandations made for the user (optional).

We worked with 2 datasets.
1. MovieLens 100k : https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
2. Jester 100k jokes : http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/
